# Team Profile Generator
![Github licence](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description
This application generates a profile page displaying contact information for a development team. The user is prompted (using Inquirer) in the command-line to enter each employee's information. When user has completed entry of employees, an HTML file is generated (using FS) displaying each employee's specific info to cards. Test Driven Development (TDD) using Jest and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) were used to build application from desired result to initiation functions.

## Usage
<a id="usage"></a>
User will need to run "npm start" or "node index.js" from the command line to begin application. The user will then be prompted to first enter information for their Team Manager. The user will then be able to enter information for employees as either an "Engineer" or "Intern". When user has completed entering all employees, an HTML file will then be generated to the local distribution folder. This HTML file will provide user with their full team's information in an easy to read layout. The page will also provide live links so user may email an employee directly or view an engineer's GitHub profile.
